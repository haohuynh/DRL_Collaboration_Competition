# Udacity Deep Reinforcement Learning: Collaboration & Competition Report

## The MADDPG Algorithm
Please see https://github.com/haohuynh/DRL_Continuous_Control/blob/main/Report.md for the fundamental characteristics of DDPG.
MADDPG is developed on top of DDPG (Comming Soon!)

## Plot of Rewards

## Ideas for Future Work
Try to implement both Independent & Master Agent approaches with different Actor-Critic algorithms, then compare & contrast the effectiveness of these methods.
